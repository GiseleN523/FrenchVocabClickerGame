# French Vocab Game

This game was written in Winter of 2025 using the P5 library, for my Creative Coding and Generative AI class. It was inspired by geography games where the user has to click on an image to select the correct 
state/country. Instead, the user is presented with a room (a bedroom in this case, although the game could easily be extended to add more rooms), and they have to select the object corresponding to the French word 
given. Once they find the correct object, they then have to choose the correct gender (masculine or feminine) for the word. The game ends when they have identified all objects. The background image for this game
was generated using DALL-E, and basic functionality is based on our professor's demonstration.
